To run the benchmarks, you need to have [Racket](http://racket-lang.org/) and [CVC4 1.3 and up](http://cvc4.cs.nyu.edu/web/) installed. This program assumes "cvc4" is available in your system's path. There should be no other prerequisites to run the program.

The tool will still run without CVC4. It is just less precise.

The program has been tested to work with Racket 5.3.5 and 6.0 and CVC4 1.3.

Each benchmark times out after 20 minutes.

To create an executable, run:
> raco exe run.rkt

This will produce a binary named `run`, `run.exe`, or `run.app` depending on operating systems.
The compilation will take a while.
To run the resulting executable on Linux, do:
> ./run

By default, this will verify all source files with extension `.sch` in the same directory
and print out results.
In pretty-printed results, elipses `...` stand for free variables,
and `L₁`, `L₂`, etc. stand for a labels.

To run only specific tests, for example, only `foldr` and `foldl`, do:
> ./run foldl.sch foldr.sch

Changes since submission to ICFP on March 1st:
* [cpstak](https://github.com/philnguyen/soft-contract/blob/master/benchmark-verification/cpstak.sch) no longer timeouts
